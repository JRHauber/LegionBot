# Legionnaire Bot

## This is a bot created for BitCraft resource management by Lanidae, Benevo, and Cj from The Legion.


## Requests Commands

### These commands handle individual resource requests

### $request <resource>

	This command will enter a new request into the database. Try to keep the thing you're requesting short, under 40 characters.

	Example: $request 50 T1 Planks

### $claim <request id>

	This command will have you claim a request, saying you will be the one to complete it.

	Example : $claim 72

### $complete <request id>

	This command will complete a request you have claimed. If you have not claimed the request, it will not complete it.

	Example : $complete 72

### $requests

	This command shows all of the requests that you have made and that have not been completed yet

### $claims

	This commands shows all of the requests you have claimed and not completed yet

### $requestlist

### There is a method for larger scale projects, but that has not yet been moved over to the new storage system, so is unused for now.
